# PhotoBooth_App
The Inspiration for this project came from my working knowledge of Mathematica's image processing capabilities and my gained understanding of the dynamic function. Thus the goal of this project is to make an interactive Photo Booth, one that is unique from what we currently have on our phones and other devices.
